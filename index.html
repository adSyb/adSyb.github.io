					Produced as part of a course in visualization of spatial and temporal data, this project visualizes 
					data regarding various socio-economic statistics at the county, school district, neighborhood and 
					individual school level using color value and proportional symbols. Additionally, the data is visualized over time. 
					A time slider use used to select the year.The goal of the project was to combine multiple variables with a 
					spatial and time component within a single visualization in order to reveal patterns.</div>

					<h4>Kakamega Forest "Puzzli"</h4>
					<div class="descText" id="puText">
					This project is based on the analog Kakamega Forest Puzzle "Puzzli" created by L. Paul in conjunction 
					with her Master's thesis at the Hochschule Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. The purpose of this 
					project was to create a browser-based version of the puzzle for use in the Kakamega Forest Information Center.
					<br/><br/>
					From the game tutorial:
					<br/><br/>
					"Just over 100 years ago, the Kakamega and Nandi Forests were connected and made up one large, forested area. 
					Through studying old forest maps, aerial photographs taken from an airplane, and satellite imagery taken 
					from space, we can see how the forest has changed over time.
					<br/><br/>
					To finish to game, fill the game area with all of the colored puzzle pieces representing the natural 
					forest cover. The game will proceed in 3 rounds – one round for each time period – 2013, 1948/52, and 1912/13.
					<br/><br/>
					The goal of each round is to puzzle the pieces containing the colors for the respective year. The colors 
					which should be puzzled during each round can be read from the color legend. For example, during the first 
					round, 2013, the colors green, turquois and brown should be puzzled.
					<br/><br/>
					The pieces are located in the baskets below. After you place all the pieces for one round, you will be able 
					to read about the forest cover durig that time period, and the reasons why some areas have lost or gained forest."</div>
